  ## Description
  
  This project was made Using Node JS and the npm Inquirer package. It was made to test what I've learned up regarding these implementations to showcase my understanding of it. This README is generated using the CLI program that I have written and has aided in furthering my understanding. As well as grasping the basic concept of node and npm packages. All of the necessary working files can be found in the /assets folder of the repo.
